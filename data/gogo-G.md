## Gas Optimizations Report

### The usage of `++i` will cost less gas than `i++`. The same change can be applied to `i--` as well.

This change would save up to 6 gas per instance/loop.

_There are **3** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/Exchange.sol

184:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < executionsLength; i++) {

307:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) {

598:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < fees.length; i++) {
```

### `internal` and `private` functions that are called only once should be inlined.

The execution of a non-inlined function would cost up to 40 more gas because of two extra `jump`s as well as some other instructions.

_There are **1** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/Pool.sol

70:   function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) private {
```

### It costs more gas to initialize non-`constant`/non-`immutable` variables to zero than to let the default of zero be applied

Not overwriting the default for stack variables saves 8 gas. Storage and memory variables have larger savings

_There are **6** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/Exchange.sol

146:  bool public isInternal = false;

147:  uint256 public remainingETH = 0;

184:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < executionsLength; i++) {

307:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) {

597:  uint256 totalFee = 0;

598:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < fees.length; i++) {
```

### Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas

If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that returns a tuple of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves 3406-3606 gas in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

_There are **5** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/Exchange.sol

70:   string public constant NAME = "Exchange";

71:   string public constant VERSION = "1.0";

72:   uint256 public constant INVERSE_BASIS_POINT = 10_000;

73:   address public constant WETH = 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2;

74:   address public constant POOL = 0xF66CfDf074D2FFD6A4037be3A669Ed04380Aef2B;
```

### Functions that are access-restricted from most users may be marked as `payable`

Marking a function as `payable` reduces gas cost since the compiler does not have to check whether a payment was provided or not. This change will save around 21 gas per function call.

_There are **2** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/Exchange.sol

56:   function open() external onlyOwner {

60:   function close() external onlyOwner {
```

### `++i`/`i++` should be `unchecked{++I}`/`unchecked{I++}` in `for`-loops

When an increment or any arithmetic operation is not possible to overflow it should be placed in `unchecked{}` block. \This is because of the default compiler overflow and underflow safety checks since Solidity version 0.8.0. \In for-loops it saves around 30-40 gas **per loop**

```solidity
File: contracts/Exchange.sol

184:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < executionsLength; i++) {

307:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) {

598:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < fees.length; i++) {
```

### Usage of `uint`s/`int`s smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

'When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.' \ https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/internals/layout_in_storage.html \ Use a larger size then downcast where needed

_There are **6** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/Exchange.sol

184:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < executionsLength; i++) {

307:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) {

443:  uint8 v,

479:  uint8 v; bytes32 r; bytes32 s;

519:  uint8 v,

598:  for (uint8 i = 0; i < fees.length; i++) {
```

### Replace `x <= y` with `x < y + 1`, and `x >= y` with `x > y - 1`

In the EVM, there is no opcode for `>=` or `<=`. When using greater than or equal, two operations are performed: `>` and `=`. Using strict comparison operators hence saves gas

_There are **6** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/Exchange.sol

274:      sell.order.listingTime <= buy.order.listingTime ? sell.order.trader : buy.order.trader,

543:  if (sell.listingTime <= buy.listingTime) {

573:      require(remainingETH >= price);

604:  require(totalFee <= price, "Total amount of fees are more than the price");
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/main/contracts/Exchange.sol

```solidity
File: contracts/Pool.sol

45:    require(_balances[msg.sender] >= amount);

71:    require(_balances[from] >= amount);
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/main/contracts/Pool.sol

### `require()/revert()` strings longer than 32 bytes cost extra gas

Each extra memory word of bytes past the original 32 incurs an MSTORE which costs 3 gas

_There are **4** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/Exchange.sol

49:    require(isInternal, "This function should not be called directly");

295:  require(!cancelledOrFilled[hash], "Order already cancelled or filled");

604:  require(totalFee <= price, "Total amount of fees are more than the price");
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/main/contracts/Exchange.sol

```solidity
File: contracts/Pool.sol

63:        revert('Caller is not authorized to transfer');
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/main/contracts/Pool.sol

### Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas

Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save ~50 gas each time they're hitby avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string. Not defining the strings also save deployment gas
