Reduce the Size of Error Messages (Long Revert Strings)
Shortening revert strings to fit in 32 bytes will decrease deployment time gas and will decrease runtime gas when the revert condition is met.

Revert strings that are longer than 32 bytes require at least one additional mstore, along with additional overhead for computing memory offset, etc.

Revert strings > 32 bytes: I suggest shortening the revert strings to fit in 32 bytes, or using custom errors as described next. PS: Each bytes32 can store up to 32 letters (ASCII): each character is a byte.

Use Custom Errors Instead of Revert Strings to Save Gas
Custom errors from Solidity 0.8.4 are cheaper than revert strings (cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost when the revert condition is met)

Source: https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/:

Starting from Solidity v0.8.4, there is a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed through the use of custom errors. Until now, you could already use strings to give more information about failures (e.g., revert("Insufficient funds.");), but they are rather expensive, especially when it comes to deploy cost, and it is difficult to use dynamic information in them.

Custom errors are defined using the error statement, which can be used inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).

I suggest replacing revert strings with custom errors.

Functions Guaranteed To Revert When Called By Normal Users Can Be Marked Payable
If a function modifier such as onlyOwner is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as payable will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are CALLVALUE(2),DUP1(3),ISZERO(3),PUSH2(3),JUMPI(10),PUSH1(3),DUP1(3),REVERT(0),JUMPDEST(1),POP(2), which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost

==========================================================

Empty Blocks Should Be Removed Or Emit Something
The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist, or the block should do something useful, such as emitting an event or reverting. If the contract is meant to be extended, the contract should be abstract and the function signatures be added without any default implementation. If the block is an empty if-statement block to avoid doing subsequent checks in the else-if/else conditions, the else-if/else conditions should be nested under the negation of the if-statement, because they involve different classes of checks, which may lead to the introduction of errors when the code is later modified (if(x){}else if(y){...}else{...} => if(!x){if(y){...}else{...}})

It costs more gas to initialize non-constant/non-immutable variables to zero than to let the default of zero be applied
Not overwriting the default for stack variables saves 8 gas. Storage and memory variables have larger savings

>= costs less gas than >

Using > 0 costs more gas than != 0 when used on a uint in a require() statement
This change saves 6 gas https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/zeppelin/original/2X/3/363a367d6d68851f27d2679d10706cd16d788b96.png per instance. The optimization works until solidity version 0.8.13 https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/bf2c3120f24a69e489f12b3213c06c94 where there is a regression in gas costs.

Using bools for storage incurs overhead
Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled. https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/58f635312aa21f947cae5f8578638a85aa2519f5/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L23-L27 Use uint256(1) and uint256(2) for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (100 gas) for the extra SLOAD, and to avoid Gsset (20000 gas) when changing from 'false' to 'true', after having been 'true' in the past

Prefix Increments
Prefix increments are cheaper than postfix increments - 6 gas. This can mean interesting savings in for loops. Change variable++ to ++variable. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/daf72892d8a8d6eaa43b9e7d1924ccb0e612ee3c/Swivel/Swivel.sol#L100
