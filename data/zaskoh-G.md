# add external payable as not a enduser function
For all the functions that are not for endusers and only handled by admins it makes sense to add payable to save gas.

```bash
File: contracts/Exchange.sol
56:     function open() external onlyOwner {

File: contracts/Exchange.sol // need to change also in interface
60:     function close() external onlyOwner {

File: contracts/Exchange.sol // need to change also in interface
323:     function setExecutionDelegate(IExecutionDelegate _executionDelegate)
324:         external
325:         onlyOwner
326:     {

File: contracts/Exchange.sol // need to change also in interface
332:     function setPolicyManager(IPolicyManager _policyManager)
333:         external 
334:         onlyOwner
335:     {

File: contracts/Exchange.sol // need to change also in interface
341:     function setOracle(address _oracle)
342:         external 
343:         onlyOwner
344:     {

File: contracts/Exchange.sol // need to change also in interface
350:     function setBlockRange(uint256 _blockRange)
351:         external
352:         onlyOwner
353:     {

// also change public to external as not called internally and change in interface
File: contracts/Pool.sol
58:     function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
59:         public // need to change also in interface
60:         returns (bool)
61:     {

```

# change function visibility to external if function is not used internally
If a function is not used internally from the contract you should change it to external to save some gas.
```shell
File: contracts/Pool.sol
79:     function balanceOf(address user) public view returns (uint256) {

File: contracts/Pool.sol
83:     function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {

File: contracts/Pool.sol
44:     function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {

```

# use unchecked{} if overflow is not possible
If you have checked variables before any calculation and it's clear that it's not possible to overflow, you should put in the unchecked to save gas.

```bash
File: contracts/Pool.sol
35:     function deposit() public payable {
36:         _balances[msg.sender] += msg.value; // you can use unchecked, to overflow it would mean a single address would need more than uint256.max of wei.

File: contracts/Pool.sol
44:     function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
45:         require(_balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
46:         _balances[msg.sender] -= amount; // use unchecked, we know it cant overflow because of L45

File: contracts/Pool.sol
70:     function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) private {
71:         require(_balances[from] >= amount);
72:         require(to != address(0));
73:         _balances[from] -= amount; // use unchecked, we know it cant overflow because of L71

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
572:         if (msg.sender == buyer && paymentToken == address(0)) {
573:             require(remainingETH >= price);
574:             remainingETH -= price; // use unchecked, we know it cant underflow because of L573
575:         }

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
315:     function incrementNonce() external {         
316:         nonces[msg.sender] += 1; // user would need more than unit256.max transactions to the contract to overflow
317:         emit NonceIncremented(msg.sender, nonces[msg.sender]);
318:     }

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
183:         uint256 executionsLength = executions.length;
184:         for (uint8 i = 0; i < executionsLength; i++) { // move the i++ inside the function in an unchecked block

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
305:     function cancelOrders(Order[] calldata orders) external {
306:         for (uint8 i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) { // move the i++ inside the function in an unchecked block

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
597:         uint256 totalFee = 0;
598:         for (uint8 i = 0; i < fees.length; i++) { // move the i++ inside the function in an unchecked block


```

# revert with a custom Error (also mentioned in qa)
Its better to use custom Errors instead of revert's with a long string. Change it to a custom error.

```bash
File: contracts/Pool.sol
62:         if (msg.sender != EXCHANGE && msg.sender != SWAP) {
63:             revert('Caller is not authorized to transfer');
64:         }

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
640:         } else {
641:             revert("Invalid payment token");
642:         }
```
For the revert in contracts/Exchange.sol you could also remove the else and just revert if the function comes to the end and add a return in every if.

# use variable instead of state var
if you access a state variable it costs 100gas, if you have a local variable that holds the value, just use it instead of the state variable.

```bash
File: contracts/Exchange.sol
323:     function setExecutionDelegate(IExecutionDelegate _executionDelegate)
324:         external
325:         onlyOwner
326:     {
327:         require(address(_executionDelegate) != address(0), "Address cannot be zero");
328:         executionDelegate = _executionDelegate;
329:         emit NewExecutionDelegate(executionDelegate); // use _executionDelegate instead
330:     }

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
332:     function setPolicyManager(IPolicyManager _policyManager)
333:         external 
334:         onlyOwner
335:     {
336:         require(address(_policyManager) != address(0), "Address cannot be zero");
337:         policyManager = _policyManager;
338:         emit NewPolicyManager(policyManager); // use _policyManager instead
339:     }

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
341:     function setOracle(address _oracle)
342:         external
343:         onlyOwner
344:     {
345:         require(_oracle != address(0), "Address cannot be zero");
346:         oracle = _oracle;
347:         emit NewOracle(oracle); // use _oracle instead
348:     }

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
350:     function setBlockRange(uint256 _blockRange)
351:         external
352:         onlyOwner
353:     {
354:         blockRange = _blockRange;
355:         emit NewBlockRange(blockRange); // use _blockRange instead
356:     }
```


# use 2 for isOpen in contracts/Exchange.sol to save gas
You can save gas if you change the behaviour to interprete  
isOpen = 1 => open  
isOpen = 2 => closed  
as you don't need to change the value from 0 to 1 again.

```shell
File: contracts/Exchange.sol
60:     function close() external onlyOwner { 
61:         isOpen = 0; // change to 2
62:         emit Closed();
63:     }
```

The modifier whenOpen() will also work while the contract is not initilized as he is checking for isOpen==1 and reverts if not.

# refactor _transferTo function to save a jump to the function
The function _transferTo( in contracts/Exchange.sol checks in the beginning if amount == 0 and just returns.
The function itself doesn't state that it has a return value and it's better to refactor to not call it if amount == 0.

```bash
File: contracts/Exchange.sol
621:     function _transferTo(
622:         address paymentToken,
623:         address from,
624:         address to,
625:         uint256 amount
626:     ) internal {
627:         //if (amount == 0) {
628:         //    return;
629:         //}

=> and in the calling functions:

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
580:         /* Transfer remainder to seller. */
581:         if (receiveAmount > 0) 
582:             _transferTo(paymentToken, buyer, seller, receiveAmount);

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
601:             if (fee > 0) {
602:                 _transferTo(paymentToken, from, fees[i].recipient, fee);
603:             }
```
