# Upgrade open zeppelin contract dependency
An outdated OZ version is used (which has known vulnerabilities, see https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories).

Currently used:
```bash
"@openzeppelin/contracts": "4.4.1",
"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable": "^4.6.0",
```
Consider updating to > 4.7 / 4.8

# Use specific imports instead of just a global import
It's better to use the specific imports instead of just a global import. This helps to have a better overview what is realy needed and helps the developer to have a clearer view of the contract.

contracts/Pool.sol (resolved)
```bash
4: import {UUPSUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol";
5: import {OwnableUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";

7: import {IPool} from "./interfaces/IPool.sol";
```

contracts/Exchange.sol (resolved)
```bash 
05: import {UUPSUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol"; 
06: import {OwnableUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol"; 

08: import {ReentrancyGuarded} from "./lib/ReentrancyGuarded.sol"; 
09: import {EIP712} from "./lib/EIP712.sol"; 
10: import {MerkleVerifier} from "./lib/MerkleVerifier.sol"; 
11: import {IExchange} from "./interfaces/IExchange.sol"; 
12: import {IPool} from "./interfaces/IPool.sol"; 
13: import {IExecutionDelegate} from "./interfaces/IExecutionDelegate.sol"; 
14: import {IPolicyManager} from "./interfaces/IPolicyManager.sol"; 
15: import {IMatchingPolicy} from "./interfaces/IMatchingPolicy.sol";
```

# Unnecessarily import
The contracts/Exchange.sol contract has a unnecessary import that is never used and decrease readability.

Unused import:
```bash
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
```

# Consider two-phase ownsership transfer
Owner can call Pool.transferOwnership / Exchange.transferOwnership function to transfers the ownership to the new address directly. As such, there is a risk that the ownership is transferred to an invalid address, thus causing the contract to be without a owner.

# add indexed for hash in event to better query for cancelled hashes
As lot's of automated systems will be dependent on this information, it is best to add an indexed for this data.

```bash
File: contracts/Exchange.sol
99:     event OrderCancelled(bytes32 hash);
```

# dont index structs as its only a keccak256-hash
An indexed on a struct etc. is just the keccak256.  
You can add the attribute indexed to up to three parameters which adds them to a special data structure known as “topics” instead of the data part of the log. **A topic can only hold a single word (32 bytes)** so if you use a reference type for an indexed argument, the Keccak-256 hash of the value is stored as a topic instead.
```bash
File: contracts/Exchange.sol
102:     event NewExecutionDelegate(IExecutionDelegate indexed executionDelegate);
103:     event NewPolicyManager(IPolicyManager indexed policyManager);
```

# revert with a custom Error (also mentioned in gas-findings)
Its better to use custom Errors instead of revert's with a long string. Change it to a custom error.

```bash
File: contracts/Pool.sol
62:         if (msg.sender != EXCHANGE && msg.sender != SWAP) {
63:             revert('Caller is not authorized to transfer');
64:         }

File: contracts/Exchange.sol
640:         } else {
641:             revert("Invalid payment token");
642:         }
```

# Use if and throw custom error instead of empty require()
Here you can use a custom error to also give an error message back to the user.
```bash
File: contracts/Pool.sol
44:     function withdraw(uint256 amount) public { 
45:         require(_balances[msg.sender] >= amount);

```
