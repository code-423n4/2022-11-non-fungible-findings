One small good practice to include would be adding a > 0 check to the Pool.sol withdraw as it is useless to withdraw 0 amount.

Other than that it is not really something I can show with code but I think the Exchange.sol file is way too dense. It does too many things and because of that, it is hardly readable. My suggestion would be to externalize some of its functionality like the modifiers with their events and then into a separate file the signature verification. Also, storing old code in comments makes this even more unreadable. For that we have git. The project looks promising, it just needs a little organization that's it.
