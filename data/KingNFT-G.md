[G-01] Use 1 and 2 to represent 'isInternal' state to save gas
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/323b7cbf607425dd81da96c0777c8b12e800305d/contracts/Exchange.sol#L146
```
(1)
0 => 1 :  cost 22100 gas
1 => 0 :  refundable += 19900 gas, actual refund gas is based on whole TX, which is minOf(usdGasOfTx / 5, refundable)
0 => 1 => 0: net cost could be up to about 14000 gas

(2)
1 => 2 : cost 5000 gas
2 => 1 :  refundable += 2800 gas, (usdGasOfTx / 5) > ((21000 + 5000 ) / 5) > 2800    // 21000 is IntrinsicGas
1 => 2 => 1: net cost 2200 gas
```

[G-02] Set 1 wei as base value of 'remainingETH' to save gas
```
modifier setupExecution() {
    remainingETH = msg.value + 1;
    // ...
    remainingETH =1;
}
```
The reason is same with [G-01].
