### Tighly pack storage variables/optimize the order of variable declaration (From 8 SLOTS to 7 SLOTS)

Here, the storage variables can be tightly packed

### Cache storage values in memory to minimize SLOADs
The code can be optimized by minimizing the number of SLOADs.

SLOADs are expensive (100 gas after the 1st one) compared to MLOADs/MSTOREs (3 gas each). Storage values read multiple times should instead be cached in memory the first time (costing 1 SLOAD) and then read from this cache to avoid multiple SLOADs.

### Internal/Private functions only called once can be inlined to save gas

Not inlining costs 20 to 40 gas because of two extra JUMP instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

### Using unchecked blocks to save gas
Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isnâ€™t possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation), some gas can be saved by using an unchecked block
[see resource](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10695)

```

The operation `_balances[from] -= amount` cannot underflow due to the check on [Line 71](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/323b7cbf607425dd81da96c0777c8b12e800305d/contracts/Pool.sol#L71) that ensures that `_balances[from]` is greater than `amount` before performing the operation

### Using unchecked blocks to save gas - Increments in for loop can be unchecked  
The majority of Solidity for loops increment a uint256 variable that starts at 0. These increment operations never need to be checked for over/underflow because the variable will never reach the max number of uint256 (will run out of gas long before that happens). The default over/underflow check wastes gas in every iteration of virtually every for loop . eg.

e.g Let's work with a sample loop below.

```solidity
for(uint256 i; i < 10; i++){
//doSomething
}

```
can be written as shown below.
```solidity
for(uint256 i; i < 10;) {
  // loop logic
  unchecked { i++; }
}
```

We can also write  it as an inlined function like below.

```solidity
function inc(i) internal pure returns (uint256) {
  unchecked { return i + 1; }
}
for(uint256 i; i < 10; i = inc(i)) {
  // doSomething
}
```

### A modifier used only once and not being inherited should be inlined to save gas

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/323b7cbf607425dd81da96c0777c8b12e800305d/contracts/Exchange.sol#L48-L51

File: /contracts/Exchange.sol
48:    modifier internalCall() {
49:        require(isInternal, "This function should not be called directly");
50:        _;
51:    }
```

### Use shorter revert strings(less than 32 bytes) 
Every reason string takes at least 32 bytes so make sure your string fits in 32 bytes or it will become more expensive.Each extra chunk of byetes past the original 32 incurs an MSTORE which costs 3 gas

Shortening revert strings to fit in 32 bytes will decrease deployment time gas and will decrease runtime gas when the revert condition is met.
Revert strings that are longer than 32 bytes require at least one additional mstore, along with additional overhead for computing memory offset, etc.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/323b7cbf607425dd81da96c0777c8b12e800305d/contracts/Exchange.sol#L49

295:        require(!cancelledOrFilled[hash], "Order already cancelled or filled");

604:        require(totalFee <= price, "Total amount of fees are more than the price");
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/323b7cbf607425dd81da96c0777c8b12e800305d/contracts/Pool.sol#L63
```solidity
File: /contracts/Pool.sol
63:            revert('Caller is not authorized to transfer');
```
I suggest shortening the revert strings to fit in 32 bytes, or using custom errors.
