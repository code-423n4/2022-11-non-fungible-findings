## Some functions on `Pool`should be marked as `external`

These functions are not being used by the contract and can be marked as `external` to save gas.

## Optimization of `Pool:_transfer` method

Consider this optimization;

+        unchecked { _balances[to] += amount; }
 
         emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
     }
```

We can safely remove `require(_balances[from] >= amount);` because will revert with underflow on `_balances[from] -= amount;` if this condition cant be keeped.
Also we can safely add an `unchecked` wrap to `_balances[to] += amount;` also because of the previous check.
Please take a look to solmate erc20 implementation;

## Optimize `Exchange::incrementNonce` method

On [`Exchange::incrementNonce`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/323b7cbf607425dd81da96c0777c8b12e800305d/contracts/Exchange.sol#L315-L318)

Instead of
```
    function incrementNonce() external {
        nonces[msg.sender] += 1;
        emit NonceIncremented(msg.sender, nonces[msg.sender]);
    }
```
You could just;
```
    function incrementNonce() external {
      unchecked {
        emit NonceIncremented(msg.sender, nonces[msg.sender]++);
      }
    }
```
Its safe to use unchecked, its virtually impossible to overflow, also you could save the extra `SLOAD` inlining everything (or using an internal variable to save the new nonce)

## The modifier `internalCall` is used only once, just add the require to save gas
The modifier `internalCall` on [Exchange.sol#L48-L50](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/323b7cbf607425dd81da96c0777c8b12e800305d/contracts/Exchange.sol#L48-L50) is used only once in `_execute` [Exchange.sol#L238](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-non-fungible/blob/323b7cbf607425dd81da96c0777c8b12e800305d/contracts/Exchange.sol#L238) so you could just add the inline require to save gas;
